quasi_1d_euler is a CFD code for modelling simple nozzle flows.  The spatial
discretization uses summation-by-parts finite-difference operators and weakly
imposed boundary conditions.  The solution method is Newton-Krylov.

Dependencies

The code uses the Boost library and the Kona in-house library.  Make sure both
of these are installed on your machine first.  The code also uses GNU Make and
gcc.

Compiling

First, make sure the Kona directory is in your path.  For example, if you are
running the bash shell and you installed Kona in your home directory, you can
add the following line to your .bashrc file:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/your_user_name/Kona:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Change to the test_solver directory and type make.  This should compile
solver.bin and verify.bin.  Run both of those executables.

Verification

The output from solver.bin should show the L2 norm of the residual decreasing
below 1E-10 in 7 iterations.  In addition, it should show the L2 and Lmax error
in the Mach nubmer being 2.69e-5 and 4.10e-5 (approximately).  Here is some
sample output:
------------------------------------------------------
iter = 0: L2 norm of residual = 0.1772
iter = 1: L2 norm of residual = 0.0185517
iter = 2: L2 norm of residual = 0.000828069
iter = 3: L2 norm of residual = 1.64644e-05
iter = 4: L2 norm of residual = 4.55325e-07
iter = 5: L2 norm of residual = 2.08853e-08
iter = 6: L2 norm of residual = 7.22471e-10
iter = 7: L2 norm of residual = 2.78434e-11
Quasi1DEuler: NewtonKrylov converged
L2 error in Mach number   = 2.69856e-05
Lmax error in Mach number = 4.09699e-05
------------------------------------------------------

The end of the output from verify.bin lists the truncation order of accuracy of
the "fourth-order" SBP operator.  The first 6 nodes (0 thru 5) and last 6 nodes
(35 thru 40) should have order = 3 (approximately) and the remaining interior
nodes should have orders of approximately 6.  Here is a sample output of those
orders:

node 0 order = 3.03077
node 1 order = 3.0154
node 2 order = 3.03022
node 3 order = 2.98882
